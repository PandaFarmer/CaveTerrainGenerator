//Todo define rules for limiting cci crossovers, test/use ClosestPointOnSegment fn
//need to track number of leaf nodes and limit branching for proper anatomosing?
//need to count leaves differently.. 
//need to ensure crossovers don't happen, merge should happen? 

BranchCheck
//todo need to allow for low alpha 
branching when depth relative to maxdepth is small?
also make branching biased to average

Testing:
ClosestPointOnSegment
Segment to Segment Distance?

Make sure BranchDepth and Depth are incremented and utilized properly
