1 cave that only renders when looking up
2 cube of many dots
3 four dots make a corner
4 single plane with shader normal/vertex set to purple point, renders when camera on purple dot side
5 half cube with outer shader
6 half cube with inner shader
7 cube with tessalated? edges
8 Point cubes
9 sphere with noise/deform
10 sphere with lighting and points


Straight Cylinder:
The Cathedral (thin arrow tip with Cirques in lower half)
The LayerCake (mario platformer)

Tilted Cylinder?:
The Crystalline (shear diagonal with plateulike levels of stratifications)

Halved Cylinder any orientation:
The Sandwich (tunnel with variations in elevation)
The Slope (Sandwich but diagonal)

Sphere:
The Runny Egg (sphere with swamp tree runthroughs) ?
The HotHouse (reverse ulcer with flatter/striated bottom)
The Ulcer (sphere with bumps)

Flat or Molded Sphere?:
The Shale (flat elliptical with thin disc platforms)

Natural terrain types of note: 
Marsh/dried (flat) -> 
Dunes/mounds -> 
Karsts (chinese water mountains) -> 
Mesas/Eroded rock formations ->
Canyons/Crevasses

Use Subtraction operations for cirques, layer_cakes, and shales
take two cylinders and subtract one from the other..
then use the resulting shape, offset its position and voila, cirques/layer_cakes
for shales, maybe a 2D rhombus with opRevolution
or try toroid and opTwist for staircase type effect?

TODO:
Tilted/Arbitrary Cylinder

Shale
Random Sampling, limited to lower hemi-sphere or base of cylinder
