0:00 - 0:32 what's up guys welcome back to the channel and today we have another post reaction video talking about something that the devs have posted about the game almost a week ago goip released this below 
deck post talking about cave generation for deep ractic and I know I'm a little bit behind about talking about this but being out of town for the weekend and the most recent launch of Space Marine 2 has kind of 
made me get a little bit distracted but I have been wanting to look at this beefy article post and look at what they are talking about as cave generation is a very interesting and crucial large Deep Rock
0:30 - 0:59 alactic as a game so learning as much as we possibly can about it it is always a nice thing so if you guys are ready let's go through this below deck post talking about cave generation in 
Deep Rock Galactic and if we can learn anything that we maybe didn't know before by the way if you like this video and want to see more be sure to subscribe and hit the Bell so you never miss another upload hello 
miners we've got another behind the scenes Peak for you this time on one of your most requested topics cave generation let's explore how the caves of Hawes get formed thousands of times over again
0:57 - 1:31 every single day hope you like it planting a cave seed the moment you select a mission in De Rock Galactic a cave is born out in some invisible abstract the game generates a seed this is a procedurally 
generated string of numbers containing the instructions for a brand new cave system this random number decides what the cabs will look like where you'll find mineral deposits and which fiends await you within all 
of this is determined in a fraction of a second flash generated when you lock in a mission so this is actually something that I have always kind of been a little bit curious about I always assumed that
1:29 - 2:01 the caves generat when you first loaded into the mission itself but here they're kind of confirming that the mission is actually generated when you first select the mission so I guess in essence if you 
select one Mission and then immediately select a different one you will generate a completely new cave setup just by selecting a different mission in the actual space rig terminal itself this new cave is entirely 
unique there are many like it but this one is yours caves or more specifically procedurally generated caves are what defined depr Galactic they set the stage for the action giving life and Lord to the game
2:00 - 2:32 they are what make each dwarf's traversal tools relevant enabling each class function and identity and the game owes a great deal of its replayability to the Limitless pool of possible caves to explore 
so how does it all work let's dig into it so yeah that is a very important part the fact that it is procedurally generated caves and you really don't get two cave structures that are exactly the same unless you've 
played hundreds upon thousands of games pretty much every time you go into the caves regardless of what biome you're in you're going to be getting a new layout which is always something that has been
2:30 - 3:01 interesting to me in the game and I'm sure a lot of people really enjoy that aspect about it and the fact that there are so many linking types of corridors and unique generations to particular caves it 
has always been interesting to see how it kind of works and how those caves are created and now we're getting a much bigger look into it cave generation in a nutshell your cave SE gets generated right when 
you select a mission but the actual cave comes together once you hop into the drop pot okay so that actually kind of completely negates what I just said earlier great as you hurle toward tox the cave C
2:59 - 3:33 generator really gets to work cave systems come together like pearls on a string one room at a time connected by narrow winding tunnels while the overall cave system is a unique result of random 
generation the individual cave rooms are handcrafted if you imagine the cave generator is our automated Chef we still want real people to make sure it's cooking with high quality ingredients there are over a 
100 cave room templates to pick from but many of these templates also contain multiple internal randomizer variants so spawning the same template 20 different times would still produce 20 unique rooms that's some
3:31 - 4:03 crazy numbers kind of right there I knew that there were a lot of different room templates that they had when creating caves I didn't think there were over a hundred and the fact that even within 
those particular base templates there are other factors and randomizers that go into it even Beyond just the basic shape of the caves is kind of crazy and something you don't really think about too much depending
 on the mission type length and difficulty these room templates could get Warped mirrored or overlapped as the cave generator strings them together onsite Refinery emissions for example Mash multiple rooms into one
4:01 - 4:37 massive Cavern this is why you're likely to see huge herds of loot bugs during these missions because the entire caves population all get spawned at the same point that makes a lot of sense and kind 
of solves the mystery that I've been having for a long time as to why loot bugs are so prevalent on onsite refining missions and it kind of makes sense if you're on say a mining Expedition or a escort Duty 
mission where those are kind of long linear based missions the loot bugs will spawn on consistently throughout those cave systems and throughout the entire way that you go because you have a much wider area
4:36 - 5:09 coverage to go through as you progress through the actual Mission but in something like onside Refinery missions all of the rooms are clustered together and clumped into one gigantic amalgamation 
of a room so the game has to load all the population of the loot bugs into one specific space which would then make sense as to why there's so many of them but to understand how this generation really works 
we need to take a closer look at one of these cave room templates and then they showed a screenshot of what looks like as they describe either a cave room template or a Windows 98 screen saver there's no way
5:07 - 5:42 to be sure and this is what I'm imagining is what looks like when certain cave Generations spawn based on the way this looks this probably at least to me appears to be potentially an on-site refining 
cave generation like they mentioned earlier as there's a lot of overlapping rooms that are kind of mashed together and it seems to be very sort of Central and larger in the center with a couple of 
branching patterns that don't really lead anywhere but this is just basically a way for us to view and see the actual generation process of the caves as to how they work and it's very interesting to see this particular
5:40 - 6:13 aspect done in a sort of actual computation style effect it kind of puts everything into perspective that all of those lines that we're seeing are cave walls or cave paths that we are going 
to eventually be going through and the next section of the post seems to sort of describe what we're looking at with this particular image in Focus how a cave room template works every cave room template 
is composed of interesting spheres half spheres and flat planes this cluster of shapes tells the cave generation engine what sort of volume to carve out of the solid rock creating the rooms where each Mission 
takes place the
6:11 - 6:46 image above which is the image that you guys are seeing on screen right now is the template for a cave room it is the instructions that the procedural generator uses to create a unique Cavern here's 
what you are looking at green and yellow lines these lines determine the general shape of the room the yellow lines act as the outer boundary the base layer upon which the cave generator applies noises like 
textured surfaces and biospecific rock patterns the green lines are the inner boundary limiting how far this noise is allowed to fluctuate and push into the space itself smaller orange orbs you could see these
6:44 - 7:19 clustered in the center surrounded by an outer yellow wireframe these act as randomizer elements that Mark spaces that might either be hollowed out to create extra volume or filled in with a random 
protruding rock formation when this cave room is created each of these has a random chance to be activated or not this way each individual room can have an even greater degree of unique and unpredictable variety 
medium orange half spheres these half domes seen around the outer perimeter of the cave room Mark potential exit paths for the room in game these are the areas filled with compacted dirt the cave generator
7:17 - 7:53 engine uses these as nodes to link the rooms to the rest of the Cave System via tunnels orange wireframe Globe the orange sphere in the background limits the size of the cavern in the game various 
Cavern templates are sorted by by different sizes if the template in question pushes beyond the orange Globe we've got to either recategorize its size or cut it down to fit the globe so that kind of puts this 
picture into a much bigger sense of scale and Clarity because we can kind of see exactly what it is that each of these particular lines kind of represents a lot more and really makes you appreciate the level of
7:51 - 8:24 detail and care that goes into these particular cave Generations the fact that they have a specific Focus as to where individual elements of the cave actually function and fit into the template itself 
to the point where you will have certain cave protrusions or not in various sections is very impressive that they were able to put this kind of detail into something that is essentially working completely randomly 
for comparison directly below which is the picture that you guys are going to see on screen right now is the same Cavern template once it's been fed through the procedural generator and
8:22 - 8:58 rendered in the game this one template has dozens of possible major iterations that would never look quite the same if we loaded it again so this gives us an even better understanding of what they're
 talking about with all of the elements that they mentioned in the last section regarding the wire frames the randomizer elements the cave end Generations it kind of makes all of it look a little bit more like 
 something that we would see in an actual Mission which is the overall point and it's crazy to me that this cave system looks incredibly unique in terms of the way that the game is rendering it out and
8:56 - 9:27 it's computating it but this also just looks like a cave system that I've probably seen before in one of my caves however slightly different because of the way that the randomized elements happen and 
then they included another picture that includes what appears to be a earlier version of the cave generation and tunnel system that they had which had a much simpler wireframe and here you can get a little bit 
of a better idea of how the cave is laid out obviously as you can see does not have nearly as many different random elements applied to it what makes a cave fun while a computer brain is great at
9:26 - 9:58 randomly stitching a Cave System together it's not so good at deciding what sort of cave is actually fun to play that's why we have human brains in charge of that part Anders heindorf Frederickson I'm so sorry if I mispronounced your name Anders senior game designer at GOI games has been the human brain and complete human person designing the cave rooms since season 3 in his words he makes the building blocks that feed into the cave generator he's the one putting together the cave wireframes like we just looked at above as he sees it there are a few key considerations in making a good cave
9:56 - 10:30 traversal natural wayfinding and dramatic experience a cave should require players to carve out terrain and use the traversal tools to get around but it shouldn't feel like a maze while larger cave systems can get a little labyrinthine individual rooms should still feel intuitive with their shapes funneling players through to the next exit point it's about balance not so simple that it gets boring but not so complex that it feels punishing on top of that a cave room should just seem cool that one comes down to gut feeling so I definitely think that the three factors at play when designing cave
10:28 - 11:05 systems Traverse Natural Way finding and dramatic experience are definitely things that make traversal and deep rock throughout the cave systems that you go through very enjoyable the fact that every single classes traversal tool is useful in very unique and distinct ways and there are situations where all of them can be incredibly viable to help you get through just some strange terrain that you can't really quite get around or just this random pocket of this Cavern that you just need to cross where you might need the Gunner zip line or or there's just a random wall that you can't get through that the driller
11:02 - 11:39 could cut through very easily that sense of all of the classes being viable in terms of being able to Traverse caves is definitely well done and the cool Factor definitely comes into play especially once you start getting into the specific biome flora and fauna that exists which I'm sure they'll get into a little bit later where in which the caves just kind of have their own sort of feel to them where you can get these massive rooms that just have a bunch of enemies and different random points crystals plants resources you can just enter certain rooms and just think to yourself wow this is this is a very intense room to
11:36 - 12:09 go into however Anders can't guarantee all of this by hand sculpting it he still got to make the design decisions that can withstand random variation from the cave generator quote once I make a new room I'll load it in and play it a bunch of times with Scout then driller and so on sometimes I play through it and it really sucks then I've got to figure out what doesn't work and why he says it might be that the visibility is bad or the room is basically playable as some classes I can only set the framework for the space before the generator gives its own spin on it so there's a lot of trial and error so then
12:07 - 12:44 they showcased a couple of screenshots from the early days of Deep Rock Development showing some experimental room generation and shaping and textures and some of them look really interesting even though this was well early into deep Rock's development before it was in any sort of playable state it still kind of has that sort of graphy Pixy type vibe to it that everybody know knows and loves about Deep Rock and these caves still do look like things that we have seen in the stretch of Deep Rock now so we can see that the room generation process has improved but is still more or less the same since it has been at
12:43 - 13:22 its early days and accompanied with that are several sketches from different sort of styles of cave systems which some of them we have seen in game so far and some of them seem to have been a little bit more cut and it just shows that there is a wide variety of different cave systems that you can go into that have their own unique sort of feel to them some claustrophobic some more open some more organic some more sort of constructed and there's definitely a lot of variability in terms of both this and the other previous images in terms of how well the cave generation can really work biomes Furnishing the caves once
13:20 - 13:53 we've got a cave all shaped and laid out it needs the noise and debris noise is the technical term for shaping the Cave's walls ceilings and Floors basically it's about taking the perfect spherical shape of the cave framework and crumpling those surfaces into something more interesting and rocklike debris refers to the process of sprinkling in assets like smaller rock formations cobwebs hazards and the Flora and Fauna unique to the selected biomes every biome has its own distinct patterns of noises and debris Robert fris studio art director and co-founder of ghost ship games and also the voice
13:50 - 14:22 of Mission Control began working on different biomes just a few months into the game's development as he sees it hays's different biomes are an essential dimension of the game's procedural generation firstly they gave a lot of character to the plan of haxus but it's also a big way for us to boost the gameplay's replayability he says the exact same level will look and play differently depending on which biome is then added on top it determines the enemies and interactive hazards you'll meet things like fog and lighting can be completely different even the shapes of the caves themselves will be different
14:21 - 14:52 and it's then up to the player to figure out how to navigate it so as I said previously a lot of what makes the cave so fun and enjoyable to go through especially multiple times is the difference between the different biomes that you have and the kinds of hazards that you will go through depending on which one you're on and they're so ridiculously unique to the point where you have people who like certain biomes more than others and certain biomes just feel naturally a lot more punishing to go through the fungus bogs for example is one that I will be on record saying that I think is one of the most
14:50 - 15:22 difficult ones and I still stand by that because the hazards are just very annoying they're very prominent and ultimately the biome itself just has this very foul and difficult even just feel to it even in just the typography the type of Flora and Fauna that exist and the kinds of things that you'll go through there and you compare that with something like say sand blastic corridors which feels completely different in many different ways both in terms of just the way that the terrain functions to the hazards to the types of unique enemies that you come across it's very clear that they put a lot of time
15:19 - 15:52 and effort into the different biomes that they want to make sure that they all feel different especially when going through them multiple times your selected biome tells the procedural generator how to sculpt the cave surfaces and now to populated with flora and fauna each biome has a distinctive texture palette magmacore for example applies sharp rigid ceilings and craggy Jagged edges to most of the surfaces sand blastic corridors by contrast is appropriately smoothed eroded and sparse nobody at ghost ship games is a professional geologist so most aesthetic choices here come down to what looks and
15:50 - 16:25 feels cool tox's biome draws from Real World caves as well as fiction areas like salt pits glacial strata or even crystallin Caverns resemble something that you might find on Earth while biomes like the Azure wield reflect inspiration from the Luminous Landscapes of Avatar in essence you could view biomes as the finishing touches Department cave generation if the wireframe structure decides the shape of the Cave the noise and debris are the wallpaper and Furnishings so then they show us a couple of images talking about the early versions of the game's experimental sort of blockier style
16:22 - 17:01 terrain system where it starts off you know very very smooth very rigid and then by varying degrees of of smoothing out desolation and adding in the extra noise and debris that they were talking about you get cave systems that feel significantly more organic and like they are in some sort of underground location it's very interesting to see how we can go from something that looks like it is rendered directly in a computer to something that does look a lot more natural more smooth and have a lot more of a actual cave likee structure to it it's very clear to see the evolution from the early stages of the games
16:58 - 17:35 production to what we currently have now new caves tomorrow and forever there's some statistic out there about how you can connect six standard Lego bricks in about a billion different ways you might think about Deep Rock alactic procedural cave generators as working in a very similar way but instead of six bricks you got a pool of 119 handcrafted rooms and 10 biomes to pick from plus it can warp and tweak and overlap all these elements before snapping them together the infinite cave engine runs around the clock day in and day out 365 days a year on an average day the cave generator produces about
17:32 - 18:07 150,000 new cave systems for players on Steam since the game launched to Early Access in 2018 deproc alactic players have generated and explored well over half a billion unique cave systems first of all that is an absolutely astronomical number I did not think that that sort of thing could happen and it just really goes to show just how many people are actually playing this and how many people go through mission after mission the fact that this thing is running around the clock and is basically putting together new cave generations and I'm assuming it's set up in a way that it won't repeat specific
18:04 - 18:41 combinations so it is 100% unique all the time in some ways you could say that the cave machine is The Game's main character in any case it's the playmaker and dungeon master setting the stage for all the rest it's the one that you thank for the gigantic dramatic Caverns that stretch out into the darkness as well as the idiotically narrow corridors that cost you the mission when you're rushing to extract is with you on every Mission whether it's your first or your Millions it'll be there as long as hoxis has minerals to mine knitting new caves out in the endless dark so that is a very good thing to note that I never really
18:39 - 19:14 thought about is that the cave generator is basically like the dungeon master of this game because you're kind of at its Mercy at any given point regardless of what mission you're in and sometimes it's your best friend and it makes the mission very easy and sometimes it really has it out for you and it just wants you to suffer in every way shape or form overall though I thought that this was a very interesting post that gave me some more serious insight into the cave generation that I never really thought of I knew the system was in depth and I knew that it had some really intricate pieces into it but I didn't
19:11 - 19:45 know it was this complex or had this many different layers to it and this just goes to show that de Rock really does have a very unique style of procedural generation that you don't really see in too many games out there today I know me personally I'm going to be paying a lot more attention to the caves that I go through through from this point forward to see if I can see any kind of repeat in any sort of way shape or form and it's going to be a lot harder for me to tell from this point and I know that with previous Seasons even including this most recent season they have added new cave generation
19:42 - 20:13 options for us to give us even more ways for the caves to be unique so I cannot wait to see what they decide to do in the future potentially with more biomes with even more cave Generations they really do have just an endless toolbox that they can go with this anyway I hope you guys enjoyed learning more about the C generation system I know I did and hopefully goip does more of these below deck posts on a more regular basis because I love learning more things about this game and I'm sure you guys will too and I know I was a little bit delayed with this particular one but from the rest of them going forward I'm
20:11 - 20:34 going to try to be as up to date with them as I possibly can anyway I hope you guys found this video informative and entertaining if you did please be sure to give it a like because it tells me what types of videos you guys want to see and consider becoming a member today as it really helps me out a lot rocket Stone miners I will see you in the next video [Music]

The Cathedral (thin arrow tip with Cirques in lower half)
The LayerCake (mario platformer)
The Runny Egg (sphere with swamp tree runthroughs)
The Shale (flat elliptical with thin disc platforms)
The Ulcer (sphere with bumps)
The Sandwich (tunnel with variations in elevation)
The Crystalline (shear diagonal with plateulike levels of stratifications)
The Slope (Sandwich but diagonal)
The HotHouse (reverse ulcer with flatter/striated bottom)
The Abyss

how to acheive striated areas? 

-missing or need some param changes? sea caves, thick wall between rooms with hole

natural terrain types of note: 
Mesas/Eroded rock formations
Karsts (chinese water mountains)
Dunes/mounds
Marsh/dried (flat)
Canyons/Crevasses

overall generation types: https://startcaving.com/caving-guides/passages
Branchwork, Network(lattice), sponge(blob) anastomosing(riverbed looking)

in actuality- generation pathing- linear, branching, branching with reconvergence

how to get anastomosing? need different type of lacunarity rules than branching..
desired behavior- after 1-3? "branch_depth_meander_range" on "branch depth", converge if depth closest to deepest depth
"depth" vs. "branch depth"

MOAR FEATURES?:
resolution scaling
vertex generation along plateu/mesas? or improved get_sample_values
